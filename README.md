# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  missing error handling for invalid user IDs.  The provided code attempts to parse a user ID as an integer without validating the input, which can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the faulty code.  It attempts to find a user by ID, but doesn't handle the case where the ID is not a valid number or if the user is not found. This can result in unexpected behavior, such as application crashes or incorrect responses.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version of the code.  It incorporates input validation to ensure that the user ID is a number and includes comprehensive error handling for cases where the user is not found.
